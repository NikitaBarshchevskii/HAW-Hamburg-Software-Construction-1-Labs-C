   1. 7/10
   
   a) From mathematical point of view, the result will be 0.7
   b) The result from the calculator will be: 
      
      7 + 10 = 17
      7 - 10 = -3
      7 * 10 = 70
      7 / 10 = 0
      7 % 10 = 7
      
      Everything here is correct, except the division. Since we are dealing with the integer number the result will be 0 instead of 0.7

   2. 7/0
      
      The program will do the first three operations, and will stop when it comes to division, because division with 0 is not defined.

   3. Digit Sum

   a) If I have 10 apples and I need to give an apple to 7 people, I will be left with 3 (My explanation of modulo %)
   b) The result will be:
      0 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 7, because we have defined the program with the expectation that the user will input the four digit year of birth.

   c) The result will be:
      20 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 36, as already mentioned, we wrote the program with the expectation that the user will input the four digit year of birth,
      therefore, the last operation modulo will be 20.
